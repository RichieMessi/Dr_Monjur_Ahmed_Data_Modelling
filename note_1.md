># __What is a Database ?__

* Where we keep data
* Keeping data without planning is problematic
* Need a specific structure to organize data - TABLES

>## __Students Table__
| StudentID | Name          |      Address     |
| ----      | -----         |      -------     |
| 1         | JohnDoe       |      Hamilton    |
| 2         | MaryJane      |      Mississauga |
| 3         | JohnDoe       |      Hamilton    |
| 4         | MaryJane      |      Mississauga |

> Vertical section = column = __*Domain*__ bcoz only one type of data exists in this section

> Horizontal section = row =  __*Record*__ bcoz data in this section belongs to only one student 

* Table is a collection of rows and columns or a collection of records and domains
* Database is a collection of tables


> Difference between Relational Database and a Database ?

* Database
    *  A random collection of tables
* Relationanl Database
    *  Not random collection. The tables have a relation or a connection in between each other


> Why Relational Database 

 ##### Table 1 - Admissions Department
| ID |  Name    | Address   |
| -- |  ----    |  -------  |
| 1  |  John    | New York California  |
| 2  |  Mary    | New Jsy   |
| 3  |  Rich    | Toronto   |
| 4  |  Jake    | Greenland |

* ## In the tables 1 and 2
    * John has two different addresses.  John can have two different databases
    * Primary Address and Secondary Address
    * However - The address is different in two different tables
    * This implies that this is not an example of a relational database
    * Something is clearly wrong with this design
    * Lets say John used to live in California at first but then moved to CANADA, after some years we query the database, how can I know which one is the correct address when a record shows two different addresses. This creates a problem
    * This is one reason why we make a relational database
##### Table 2- Accounts Department
| ID |  Name    | Address   |       Fees    |   Paid    | Due   |
| -- |  ----    |  -------  |       ------- | -------   | ------|
| 1  |  John    | New York Canada|  1000    |   300     |  700  |
| 2  |  Mary    | New Jsy   |       1500    |   500     |  1000 |
| 3  |  Rich    | Toronto   |       1200    |   1000    |   200 |
| 4  |  Jake    | Greenland |       1000    |   400     |   600 |

>  NOW here is how a relational database would look like. This is not a good database design however, this shows how a duplicate address problem that we saw above can be rectified


##### Table 1 - Admissions Department
| ID |  Name    | Address   |
| -- |  ----    |  -------  |
| 1  |  John    | New York California  |
| 2  |  Mary    | New Jsy   |
| 3  |  Rich    | Toronto   |
| 4  |  Jake    | Greenland |

* ## In the tables 1 and 2
    * Now address is just in one table, Addmissions Table has to use the primary key of Accounts Department to inquire a students address. 
    * There is only one table that has address. Therefore, there is no redundancy
    * This design still has problems that we will fix as we go further. 
    * For the meantime, this  solves the mistaching problem of the address
    * In both tables, every record in both tables is linked to each other through an ID. Both records in two tables with common ID are linked to each otehr through the ID. 
 ##### Table 2- Accounts Department
| ID |  Fees    |   Paid    | Due   |
| -- |  ------- | -------   | ------|
| 1  |  1000    |   300     |  700  |
| 2  |  1500    |   500     |  1000 |
| 3  |  1200    |   1000    |   200 |
| 4  |  1000    |   400     |   600 |

![markdown Logo](./images/key_relation.png)

> Every row in a database musy have a unique identifier
* This has to be unique to avoid the same problem we saw above *Redudancy* is *bad* coz its leads to confusion ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ . 
 * Names cannot be used as a unique identifier as people can have unique names
 * We cannot ask people to change their names coz we need to add them to a database lol. That would suck ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢

 > Primary key ðŸ”‘ : it is a unique value  and it will never appear twice
 
 > Foreign key ðŸ”‘ :  what the hell is this now ? lol .... Lets find our bro ðŸ˜Ž
 * To find out what foreign key, lets look at the table again...



 ##### Table 1 - Admissions Department
| ðŸ”‘ID     |  Name    | Address   |
| --     |  ----    |  -------  |
|   1  |  John    | New York California  |
|   2  |  Mary    | New Jsy   |
|   3  |  Rich    | Toronto   |
|   4  |  Jake    | Greenland |
 
 ##### Table 2- Accounts Department
| ðŸ”‘ID     |   Paid |
| ----   | -------|   
|   1   |   300  | 
|   2   |   500  |  
|   3   |   1000 |   
|   4   |   400  |   


*  In the tables 1 and 2
    * Both tables are connected with a unique identifier ( Primary Key ðŸ”‘)
    * HOWEVER, the tables are still not relational... ðŸ˜¢
    * WHY? bcoz of two main problems 
        * If someone else also paid an amount of ðŸ’° 300 dollars, How can we check from the "paid" column which student paid 300 dollars. basically, 300 can be repeated among different students. It is not unique. Just by looking at the paid amount, we cannot determine which amount 300 ðŸ’° goes to which person
        * What if we need an invoice number, there is no way to add that field
        * If a student ðŸ‘¶ wants to add another payment, (multiple payments), how will we keep track, 9n the current database, we will have to add another record with same primary key ðŸ”‘ to add another payment. 
        * BUT this violates the rule of no redudancy  . In a good database design, the primary key should only belong to only one record. No duplication 


> Solution - Foreign Key ðŸ”‘

 
 ##### Table 1- Accounts Department
| ðŸ”‘Transaction ID       |   Paid |       StudentID   |
|           ----       | -------|       ----------  |
|     001            |   300  |       1234        |
|     002            |   500  |       3245        |
|     003            |   1000 |       7345        |
|     004            |   400  |       1234        |
|     005            |   400  |       2453        |
|     006            |   400  |       3245        |
|     007            |   400  |       1234        |
|     008            |   400  |       7345        |


 ##### Table 2 - Admissions Department
| ðŸ”‘Student ID            |  Name    | Address   |
|        --             |  ----    |  -------  |
|    1234       |  John    | New York California  |
|    3245       |  Mary    | New Jsy   |
|    2453       |  Rich    | Toronto   |
|    7345       |  Jake    | Greenland |

* Now each primary key of a student is being used as a ðŸ”‘primary key in the Student Table and as a ðŸ”‘foreign key linking to its transaction in the Accounts table.
* This way, Accounts table can have multiple records for students with multiple transactions / payments
* All we have to do is repeat the Student ID associated with the transaction HOWEVER, every transaction/payment is different even if belongs to 1 student ðŸ‘¶
* This ensures all transactions can be tracked with a unique identifier ( ðŸ”‘ ) and not repeat the Student ID again and again as it is being used as a ðŸ”‘ primary key in its own table 




> # Meta Data
* It is the data about data
* What kind of data we store in a column
* Let's say in the below table, what kind of data do we store in each column or domain? 
* Its either numbers or characters etc
* Datatype is metadata. Digits, Characters or Alpha Numerics (both chars and nums)

| ðŸ”‘Student ID            |  Name    | Address   |
|        --             |  ----    |  -------  |
|    1234       |  John    | New York California  |
|    3245       |  Mary    | New Jsy   |
|    2453       |  Rich    | Toronto   |
|    7345       |  Jake    | Greenland |



> # Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
* It is a diagram that shows a relationship among entities


### Problem Scanerio
* A small burder shop sells differenk kinds of burgers. The  manager looks after the overall operations of the store. Other staff include the chef and two front counter repsentatives. The customers userd to order only by walking-in into the store, but the shop recently added phone ordering. The shop has a loyal customer base, and the phone ordering system is implemented as a relust of survey among the customers
